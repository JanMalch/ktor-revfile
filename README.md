# Ktor RevFile

A [Ktor server plugin](https://ktor.io/docs/server-plugins.html) made for automatically revisioning static files.

A revisioned file will include a short hash of its content in the file name.
This enables optimal caching without you ever having to change the name of the local file.

Checkout the [complete documentation](https://janmalch.github.io/ktor-revfile) for usage details.
